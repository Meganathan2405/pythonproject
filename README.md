## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset containing information about laptop sales. The goal is to uncover trends, outliers, correlations, and patterns to assist in business decision-making using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the structure and distribution of the data
- Clean and preprocess the data (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)
- Derive new metrics for deeper insight
- Perform statistical and visual analysis (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate)
- Generate actionable business insights based on the data

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

The dataset includes details such as:
- Laptop Brand and Model
- RAM, Processor, Storage Type
- Price and Weight
- Offers (e.g., Mouse, Keyboard)
- Operating System

> **Note**: Dataset is not publicly shared here due to usage restrictions. Replace with your own dataset if replicating.

## 🔁 Project Workflow

1. Data Import & Inspection
2. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Outlier removal
   - Standardizing values
3. Derived Metrics (e.g., Price per GB RAM)
4. Statistical Summary & Hypothesis Testing
5. Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Visual Analysis
6. Insight Generation & Conclusion

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 2GB RAM laptops sell the most
- Accessories boost sales when bundled with base models
- Certain brands dominate specific price segments
- Lightweight laptops are more preferred

---

## 🧠 Business Impact

The analysis suggests businesses should focus on bundling strategies and stock laptops with specific configurations (like 2GB RAM) to maximize sales and reduce excess inventory.
